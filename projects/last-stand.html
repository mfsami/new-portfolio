              <p>
                Last Stand is a 2D top-down zombie survival shooter I built for
                a spring-semester class project. I was both the
                <em>developer</em> and the <em>artist</em>, which meant writing
                systems by day and pushing pixels by night. My professor took a
                real liking to it (always nice when office hours turn into mini
                playtests).
              </p>

              <p>
                Under the hood it’s clean architecture:
                <span class="orangeText">Unity</span> +
                <span class="orangeText">C#</span> with solid
                <span class="orangeText">OOP</span> for modular systems. Core
                gameplay includes responsive shooting, state-based enemy AI
                (patrol → chase → attack), and animation control tied to
                movement/aim. Weapons, health, and enemy logic are decoupled
                components so features can swap in without breaking others.
              </p>

              <!-- <figure class="stage">
                <img
                  src="../assets/images/teamsStats.png"
                  alt="Winter Soccer League UI mock" />
              </figure> -->

              <p>
                I also wrote custom camera/rendering scripts for a pixel-perfect
                look—orthographic sizing, integer snapping, and jitter-free
                movement. Think “retro crisp,” not “retro blurry.”
              </p>

              <p>
                On the art side: I’m <em>not</em> a seasoned pixel artist, but
                I’m a lifelong gamer and I’m quite proud of how the visuals
                landed. I drew from a bunch of top-down shooters I’ve played
                over the years for silhouettes, readability, and juice. It was a
                blast to build—equal parts study session and nostalgia trip.
              </p>

              <p>Add shop menu gif</p>

              <p>
                My favourite feature was this shop menu I built. Took me days to
                battle with Unity animations. I do think my background in Adobe
                products actually helped me quite well here. But i am super
                proud of how this turned out.
              </p>

              <p>
                The biggest lesson from this project was scope. The real final
                boss. With so many ideas, it’s tempting to bolt on every wild
                feature. I wrestled with that early, then learned to pick my
                battles and keep the core tight. I’m happy with the balance I
                landed on, and I can see this expanding further in the future.
              </p>
