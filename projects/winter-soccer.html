              <p>
                A local winter soccer tournament needed a simple way to track
                player stats, standings, teams, and weekly highlights across a
                yearly three-week season. I was referred by my friend Adnan, who
                told me that they needed someone who could design it cleanly and
                ship it quickly. So I took it on and built the leagues site.
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                “We need a site where players can see standings, top scorers,
                highlights and anything related to the tournament”
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                Immediatley got to work building up wireframes and designs in
                Figma then transferring it over to clean code. This became the
                first full React project I completed end-to-end. The very first
                version of this site in 2023 was a plain HTML/CSS site, I sort
                of cringe looking back at it. The next year I redesigned it in
                ReactJS with a cleaner layout, better typography, and a
                mobile-first flow, as most players would access it off of their
                phones. This was my first time having to deal with clients.
                Every new idea or devleopment I had was always ran through the
                tournament owners before committing. This established a pretty
                good developer client relationship. The site now pulls together
                teams, fixtures, results, leaderboards, and media in one place.
              </p>

              </figure>

              <p>
                I’m the dedicated developer and maintainer each winter, keeping
                everything updated during the tournament. The crew liked the
                site <em>so much</em> they even drafted me onto a team... so
                yes, I now track my own stats too. This project taught me a ton
                about practical web dev: structuring data, state and UI, and
                designing for speed when people are checking scores on the
                sideline. I’ve got a backlog of enhancements I plan to add next
                season.
